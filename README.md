# Note:

This software has been prepared for educational purposes only.
It is a software open to development, do not expect support.

The software scans your mailing list and checks whether it is registered on Instagram. If registered e-mail addresses are empty, you can retrieve these addresses.

I recommend residential proxy for fast transactions.

You are free to develop the software, I take no responsibility.
